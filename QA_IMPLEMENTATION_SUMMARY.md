## 🔧 How to Use the New Testing Infrastructure

### Running Backend Tests
```bash
cd backend
npm test                                    # Run all tests
npm test -- tests/auth.test.js            # Run specific test file
npm test -- --coverage                    # Run with coverage
npm run test:security                     # Run security tests
```

### Running Frontend Tests
```bash
cd frontend
npm run test                              # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:run                          # Run tests once
npm run test:coverage                     # Run with coverage
npm run test:ui                           # Run with UI interface
```

### Running Performance Tests
```bash
# Make script executable (Linux/Mac)
chmod +x scripts/run-performance-tests.sh

# Run all performance tests
./scripts/run-performance-tests.sh

# Run specific test types
./scripts/run-performance-tests.sh load
./scripts/run-performance-tests.sh stress
./scripts/run-performance-tests.sh spike
```
